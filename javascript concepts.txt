                        JAVASCRIPT

    -dynamically typed language.
                              
                            VARIABLES
    1.let= 
    this keyword is used with variables that can be updated but they can't be repeated.
    like,
       let age=12;
         if i want to update it, i can do this,
        age=25;
        or
        age=age+3;

    2.const=
    this keyword is used with those variable that can't be repeated and updated.
    we use it like,
        const age=12;

    *we can't update it BUT, if it is used as object's key, then it can be updated.
    we can do that by creating object.
     const student={
          name:"hafsa";
          age:22;
          cgpa:3.4;
          degree:"BS-IT";
     };
     console.log(student["name"]); 
     //let's update
     student.name="sheraz";
     console.log(student);

    * You can use both dot(.) or bracket way of calling athe variable.

    *We dont need to declare the datatypes with each variable. Language is smart enough to figure out on its own.

    3.functions=
     Can be written by 3 methods.
         i- function greeet(){
            console.log('hi');
         };
         greet();

         ii- const greet=function(){
            console.log('hi');
         };
         greet();

         iii- const greet=()=> {  days.
            console.logg('hi');     
         };
         greet();
       
    4. conditionals=
             if 
             else if
             else
             ==     loose comparison(no data type restriction)
             ===    strict comparison(same datatypes only)
             !=     not equal (loose)
             !==    not equal(strict)
             >      greater than
             <      less than
             >=     greater than or equal to
             <=     less than or equal to

    5. logical operators=
            &&        true and true
            . or ||   OR
            !         NOT
