                        JAVASCRIPT

    -dynamically typed language.
                              
                            VARIABLES
    1.let= 
    this keyword is used with variables that can be updated but they can't be repeated.
    like,
       let age=12;
         if i want to update it, i can do this,
        age=25;
        or
        age=age+3;

    2.const=
    this keyword is used with those variable that can't be repeated and updated.
    we use it like,
        const age=12;

    *we can't update it BUT, if it is used as object's key, then it can be updated.
    we can do that by creating object.
     const student={
          name:"hafsa";
          age:22;
          cgpa:3.4;
          degree:"BS-IT";
     };
     console.log(student["name"]); 
     //let's update
     student.name="sheraz";
     console.log(student);

    * You can use both dot(.) or bracket way of calling athe variable.

    *We dont need to declare the datatypes with each variable. Language is smart enough to figure out on its own.

    3.functions=
     Can be written by 3 methods.
         i- function greeet(){
            console.log('hi');
         };
         greet();

         ii- const greet=function(){
            console.log('hi');
         };
         greet();

         iii- const greet=()=> {  days.
            console.logg('hi');     
         };
         greet();
       
    4. conditionals=
             if 
             else if
             else
             ==     loose comparison(no data type restriction)
             ===    strict comparison(same datatypes only)
             !=     not equal (loose)
             !==    not equal(strict)
             >      greater than
             <      less than
             >=     greater than or equal to
             <=     less than or equal to

    5. logical operators=
            &&        true and true
            . or ||   OR
            !         NOT


   6. array:
           let array=[1,2,3,4,5];
           console.log(array[1]);      //output would be 2.

           Update:
           array[0]=0;
           console.log(array[0]);     //1 was replaced by 0.

           array length:
           console.log(array.length);

           add to end:
           array.push(6);
           console.log(array);       //array=[0,2,3,4,5,6]

           remove from end:
           array.pop();

           to check correct value:
           array.include(value);

           remove first element:
           array.shift();

           add value at start:
           array.unshift(value);

           splice:
           splice(startIndex, deleteCount,value)
                 has three methods.

                 -remove element:
                 let fruits=["apple","banana","mango];
                 fruits.splice(1,2);
                 console.log(fruits);     //output= fruits=["mango"]

                 -insert element:
                 let fruits=["apple","banana","mango"];
                 fruits.splice[1,0,"pear"];
                 concole.log(fruits);           //output=fruits=["apple","pear","banana","mango"]

                 -replace element:
                 let fruits=["apple","banana","mango"];
                 fruits.splice[0,1,"pear"];
                 concole.log(fruits);            //output=fruits=["apple","pear","mango"]

            slice:
            creates copy of array till desired length.
            let no=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
            let sliced=fruits.slice(1,4);
            console.log(sliced);          //output=[2,3,4,5]

            indexOf;
            array.indexOf(searchElement,fromIndex)
                 let no=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
                 console.log(no.indexOf(2));     //1
                           OR
                 console.log(no.indexOf(4,2));   //4

                 s
                 x
