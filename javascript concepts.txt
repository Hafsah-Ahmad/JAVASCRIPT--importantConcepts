                            VARIABLES
    let= 
    this keyword is used with variables that can be updated but they can't be repeated.
    like,
       let age=12;
         if i want to update it, i can do this,
        age=25;
        or
        age=age+3;

    const=
    this keyword is used with those variable that can't be repeated and updated.
    we use it like,
        const age=12;

    we can't update it BUT, if it is used as object's key, then it can be updated.
    we can do that by creating object.
     const student={
          name:"hafsa";
          age:22;
          cgpa:3.4;
          degree:"BS-IT";
     };
     console.log(student["name"]); 
     //let's update
     student.name="sheraz";
     console.log(student);

     You can use both dot(.) or bracket way of calling athe variable.
